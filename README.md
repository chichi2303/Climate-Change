# Climate-Change
Is it true that climate is changing? I believe so, however, many people do not. So in order to discover if this is actually a hoax made by China, or if it is happening at the moment, and also for me to practice my skills in plotting, I did this project 'Earth Surface Temperature Data since 1850 - 2013'. 
For the database, please go here: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data.
I will also upload all my data in my 'Climate Change' repository. 
In progress ...
